# ATM Simulator

A GUI java application which simulates an `Automated Teller Machine(ATM)` Interface to provide users with the capabilities like:

+ New users can sign up by filling up their details and the system will generate a unique `16 digit card number` and a `4 digit pin` for the user and user can then log in to the system with that credential.

+ After logging into the system the user can do the following:
  + `Withdraw money` from their account
  + `Deposit money` from their account
  + View their `account statement`
  + `Change their PIN`
  + Withdraw money using `fast cash`
  + View their `account details`

To use the application on your system, just clone this repository and run the `gradlew script(for Mac and Linux users)` or the `gradlew.bat file(for windows users)` and you are good to go :)

    You don't need to have gradle or java installed on your sytem to run the application, the script will handle all that for you.
